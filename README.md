# 🚀 My DSA & LeetCode Journey  

Hi there! 👋  
I’m currently learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to strengthen my problem-solving skills and improve my coding efficiency.  

## 📚 Learning Goals  
- Understand and implement **core data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, trees, graphs).  
- Master **algorithmic concepts** (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking, etc.).  
- Write **optimized solutions** for competitive programming problems.  

## 💻 Practice Platform  
I’ll be solving problems primarily on **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**, but may also use Codeforces, CodeChef, and GeeksforGeeks for variety.  

## 📅 Plan  
- Solve **at least 1–2 problems daily**.  
- Cover **easy → medium → hard** gradually.  
- Focus on **quality over quantity** — understanding each concept deeply before moving on.  

## 🏆 Tracking Progress  
I will keep updating this repository with:
- Problem statements  
- My solutions (in Java/Python/C++)  
- Explanations & approaches  

## ⚡ Motivation  
> *"Data structures + algorithms = coding superpowers 💪"*  
This journey will prepare me for technical interviews, competitive programming, and building efficient real-world applications.

**Let’s code smarter, not harder.**
